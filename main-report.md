## Day 1 – 30th July 2025  
The first day at GNDEC started with *Path* and *Kirtan* at the College Gurudwara Sahib, which gave a peaceful start to the program.  

In the auditorium, we were introduced to the history and journey of the college.  
- **Dr. Harpreet Kaur Grewal** welcomed us and spoke about building a strong academic base and making the most of the opportunities here.  
- **Principal Dr. Sehijpal Singh** talked about research culture and industry collaborations. His words were motivating and gave us a bigger picture of what is possible at GNDEC.  
- **Chief Guest, Sardar Maheshinder Singh Grewal**, highlighted values like discipline, hard work, and service to society.  

Later, we had departmental orientations and a campus tour. We met our faculty and got to see labs and other facilities for the first time.

## Day 2  
The second day began with two **proficiency tests**:  
- **English Test** (9:30–10:30 AM)  
- **Maths Test** (10:30–11:30 AM)  

After a short break, we had two sessions:  
- **Dr. Arashdeep Singh** gave a talk on *“Food: A Pivotal Role in Student’s Overall Wellness”*. He explained how food affects not just physical fitness but also mood, energy levels, and focus in studies. It was a reminder that what we eat has a direct impact on our daily life as students.  
- The **Cosmic Club** introduced us to GitHub. They helped us create our accounts and guided us on how to start maintaining reports and projects there. This was our first hands-on step towards using GitHub.

## Day 3  
### Lecture 1 – *Dr. Jaswinder Singh*  
Dr. Jaswinder’s lecture was very energetic and engaging. He talked about the connection between science, nature, and God, and also showed us some interesting math tricks. His humor and energy made the session enjoyable and memorable.  

### Lecture 2 – *Dr. Priya Darshni*  
She focused on human values, goals, and the purpose of life. Her step-by-step approach made it easy to understand and reflect on. Though she started quietly, the lecture built up gradually and ended with meaningful takeaways.

## Day 4  
### Lecture – *Dr. Priya Darshni*  
This session was even better than her first one. She recapped earlier points and then introduced new concepts and deeper insights about values and life. The exercises she gave us were practical and helpful.  

### Cosmic Club & Other Sessions  
We got to know more about the **Cosmic Club** and its focus on teamwork and skill development. There was also a session on buying laptops for college, which was useful. The day ended with a cultural performance (singing with guitar), adding fun to the program.

## Day 5  
There were no induction activities on this day. Instead, it focused on meeting teachers and starting with subjects. Most teachers kept things light with introductions, tips, and guidance instead of jumping straight into heavy topics. This made the first classes feel comfortable.  

---

## Day 6  
### Lecture – *Prof. Lakhvir Singh*  
He introduced us to **CML (Creative Management Lab)**, where students can build skills like leadership, teamwork, and management. At first, it felt a bit random, but once explained, it made sense why such skills are important. I found it interesting and would like to consider joining.

## Day 7  
### Introduction to Facilities – *Dr. Parminder Singh*  
We were introduced to various facilities available at GNDEC, which was useful for knowing where to find resources during our time here.  

### Lecture – *Dr. Amit Kamra*  
He introduced us to the **Digital Marketing Club (DMC)**. The club manages the social media of GNDEC and helps students learn digital skills. Though still small, the club seems promising and important for future careers.  

### Examination Guidelines – *Dr. Randhir Singh*  
The last session was about the **conduct of examinations**. He explained the rules, procedures, and evaluation system. He also guided us through the college website, showing sections like notices, results, and academic resources. Details about mid-semester tests, assignments, and submissions were also covered. This session was very informative and cleared many doubts.
